Experimental and a bit buggy. Save often...

# Overview

You start by choosing a uniform polyhedron: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_polyhedron - these are generated using the Wythoff construction.

You can then stack up Conway Operators on top to create much more complex shapes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_polyhedron_notation

# Documentation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/IxxyXR/Polyhydra/wiki)

# Credits

Obviously the original work by Willem Wythoff and John Conway. And also countless other mathematicians who have formed a base for, contributed to and extended the work in this area. A special shout out to George Hart who is often co-credited with Conway due to the large amount of work he did exploring and extending Conway's original operators. 

Partly based on https://github.com/kaonasi (which in turn is based on the work of Zvi Harâ€™El: http://www.math.technion.ac.il/S/rl/kaleido/ ).

Conway operator code by Will Pearson @mcneel from https://github.com/pearswj/buckminster

(Zvi Har'El has sadly passed away. I've tried to contact all potential copyright holders to see if it's OK to make use of their work as a basis for this but I've had no luck in getting a response. Please get in touch if you're an interested party. I'd love to put a proper open source licence on this)

My original inspiration was 3DS Max's Hedra plugin which kept me entertained for quite a while nearly 2 decades ago. :-)

# TODO

Lots. Again, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/IxxyXR/Polyhydra/wiki)
